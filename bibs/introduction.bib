	abstract = {Objectives To report on the causes of blindness certifications in England and Wales in working age adults (16{\textendash}64 years) in 2009{\textendash}2010; and to compare these with figures from 1999 to 2000. Design Analysis of the national database of blindness certificates of vision impairment (CVIs) received by the Certifications Office. Setting and participants Working age (16{\textendash}64 years) population of England and Wales. Main outcome measures Number and cause of blindness certifications. Results The Certifications Office received 1756 CVIs for blindness from persons aged between 16 and 64 inclusive between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2010. The main causes of blindness certifications were hereditary retinal disorders (354 certifications comprising 20.2\% of the total), diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (253 persons, 14.4\%) and optic atrophy (248 persons, 14.1\%). Together, these three leading causes accounted for almost 50\% of all blindness certifications. Between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000, the leading causes of blindness certification were diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy (17.7\%), hereditary retinal disorders (15.8\%) and optic atrophy (10.1\%). Conclusions For the first time in at least five decades, diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy is no longer the leading cause of certifiable blindness among working age adults in England and Wales, having been overtaken by inherited retinal disorders. This change may be related to factors including the introduction of nationwide diabetic retinopathy screening programmes in England and Wales and improved glycaemic control. Inherited retinal disease, now representing the commonest cause of certification in the working age population, has clinical and research implications, including with respect to the provision of care/resources in the NHS and the allocation of research funding.},

abstract = {Objectives To describe trends in the incidence and prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the UK by diabetes type, age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, region and calendar year.Design Cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).Setting UK primary care.Participants 7.7 million patients {\textgreater}=12 contributing to the CPRD from 2004 to 2014.Primary and secondary outcome measures Age-standardised prevalence and incidence of diabetes, DR and severe DR (requiring photocoagulation) by calendar year and population subgroup. Relative risk of developing DR and severe DR by population subgroup.Results The prevalence of DR was 48.4{\%} in the population type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (14 846/30 657) and 28.3{\%} (95 807/338 390) in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Prevalence of DR remained stable in people with T2DM and decreased in people with T1DM. Screening for DR increased over time for patients with T2DM and remained static for patients with T1DM Incidence of DR increased in parallel with the incidence of T2DM in both diabetic populations. Among patients with T2DM, relative risk of DR varied significantly by region, was increased for older age groups and in men compared with women, with risk of severe DR increased in South Asian groups and more deprived groups. Relative risk of DR for patients with T1DM varied by age and region, but not by gender, ethnic group or deprivation.Conclusions This is the largest study to date examining the burden of DR in the UK. Regional disparities in incidence may relate to differences in screening delivery and disease ascertainment. Evidence that deprivation and ethnicity are associated with a higher risk of severe DR highlights a significant potential health inequality. Findings from this study will have implications for professionals working in the diabetes and sight loss sectors, particularly to inform approaches for diagnosis of retinopathy and campaigning to better tackle the disease for at risk groups.},

abstract = {A computerized method for the detection of microaneurysms (MA) in fluorescein angiograms is proposed, using the concepts of mathematical morphology. The MA which are almost circular particles, are extracted from the image by performing different "top-hat transformations". Some particles, however, may then be detected inside the nonhomogeneous vessels, and it is necessary to be able to extract the vasculary net. The MA which present fuzzy boundaries (due to the leakage of fluorescein) are the most difficult to extract. The algorithm has been tested on 25 angiograms, with 1 045 MA analysed. A comparison between the automatic counting procedure and three manual methods of counting has been made to prove the robustness of the proposed method.},

@article{LUNDERVOLD2019,
abstract = {What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.},
