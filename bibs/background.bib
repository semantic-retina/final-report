abstract = {This work is part of an ongoing project aimed to generate synthetic retinal fundus images. This paper concentrates on the generation of synthetic vascular networks with realistic shape and texture characteristics. An example-based method, the Active Shape Model, is used to synthesize reliable vessels' shapes. An approach based on Kalman Filtering combined with an extension of the Multiresolution Hermite vascular cross-section model has been developed for the simulation of vessels' textures. The proposed method is able to generate realistic synthetic vascular networks with morphological properties that guarantee the correct flow of the blood and the oxygenation of the retinal surface observed by fundus cameras. The validity of our synthetic retinal images is demonstrated by qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis.},

abstract = {This paper aims at synthesizing multiple realistic-looking retinal (or neuronal) images from an unseen tubular structured annotation that contains the binary vessel (or neuronal) morphology. The generated phantoms are expected to preserve the same tubular structure, and resemble the visual appearance of the training images. Inspired by the recent progresses in generative adversarial nets (GANs) as well as image style transfer, our approach enjoys several advantages. It works well with a small training set with as few as 10 training examples, which is a common scenario in medical image analysis. Besides, it is capable of synthesizing diverse images from the same tubular structured annotation. Extensive experimental evaluations on various retinal fundus and neuronal imaging applications demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach.},
