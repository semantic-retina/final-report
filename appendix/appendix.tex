\section{FGADR Exclusion List} \label{sec:fgadr_excl}

This is a list of files that we determined too coarse to be used as segmentation maps, and were therefore excluded from our training data.
It can be found in CSV format in the supplementary materials repository under \lstinline{data/fgadr_denylist.csv}.

\section{Optic Disc Annotations} \label{sec:od}

For this project, we manually annotated the optic discs for the FGADR and DiaRetDB1 datasets.
This was done using the open-source Make Sense annotation tool\footnote{\url{https://www.makesense.ai}}, and are stored as JSON files under the \lstinline{data} directory.
Utilities for pre-processing datasets using these files are included in the main code repository.
Inferred annotations for e-ophtha were collected as detailed in \Cref{sec:optic_disc_inference}, and are stored as PNG files containing binary masks under the \lstinline{data/eophtha_od} directory.

\section{Models} \label{sec:models}

For reproducibility, the supplementary materials repository contains all model weights used in this project, including the ACGAN, ProGAN, ResNet, and U-Net.
These are contained under the \lstinline{models} directory.

\section{Raw Data} \label{cha:raw_data}

Raw data collected from experiments can be found as spreadsheet files under the \lstinline{raw data} directory.

\section{Mask Overlay Tool}
\begin{description}
\item[Mask Overlay Tool] \url{https://github.com/semantic-retina/mask-overlay}
\end{description}

The mask overlay tool is a small command-line program built to create labelled retinal fundus image diagrams, such as \Cref{fig:lesions}.
